## **📌 About the Project**
**ProcSim** is a virtual process scheduling simulator designed to help students understand **process scheduling algorithms** in operating systems. The goal is to provide an interactive and visual tool to simulate how different scheduling algorithms (such as **FCFS, Round Robin, and SJF**) affect process execution, waiting times, and CPU allocation.

### **Key Features**
✅ Simulates process scheduling with multiple algorithms  
✅ Real-time visualization of process execution states  
✅ Supports **preemptive** and **non-preemptive** scheduling  
✅ Interactive UI (planned for WPF/Blazor)  
✅ Logs and performance metrics for analysis

## **🚀 How It Works**
1. Users create and manage processes with different execution times.  
2. The simulator applies the selected **scheduling algorithm** (FCFS, Round Robin, etc.).  
3. The execution flow is displayed **visually (planned UI)** or via **logs (console mode)**.  
4. Users can analyze **execution time, waiting time, and turnaround time** metrics.
